#### TaCoS Conference
[Conference Website](https://tacos2021.github.io/)  ·  [Programm](https://tacosconference.github.io/agenda)

After one year of planning, we successfully held the [32. conference of computerlinguistic students (TaCoS)](https://tacosconference.github.io) at the Heinrich-Heine university in Düsseldorf. Over three days, our 57 attendees heard 12 talks, 5 keynotes and attended 3 carefully-crafted workshops.

#### KI4ALL - Video Project
[More about the project](https://www.heicad.hhu.de/en/teaching/ai-for-all/translate-to-english-zum-projekt)  ·  [Course info on KI Campus](https://ki-campus.org/courses/kifueralle-hhu?locale=en)

As part of the project ["KI4ALL"](https://www.heicad.hhu.de/en/teaching/ai-for-all/translate-to-english-zum-projekt), I got to write and film an educational video introducing practical applications for the k-nearest-neighbour algorithm. The project KI4ALL is a cooperation between the Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf and the University of Applied Sciences Düsseldorf. The project aims to make the topic of artificial intelligence accessible to a broad audience. The project is funded by the Ministry of Culture and Science of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia as part of the "Digital Higher Education" funding line.

#### Foss4All Workshop
[Workshop website](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/libreslam) · [Campus of Ideas](https://www.hhu.de/en/cdi) · [Meet Akhilesh](https://akkikek.xyz/about.html)

FOSS4ALL is a one day workshop designed to provide researchers of any discipline with an understanding of the idea of "Free/Open Source", beyond the technical realm, as a model of research development. Participants worked in groups by disciplines to apply the FOSS-framework to their respective fields and they will submit their work at the end of the event. You can see the results in our archive: [https://slam.phil.hhu.de/libreslam](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/libreslam).

We thank our brilliant speakers: Ekaterina Gabrovska, Helge Ahrens.

#### Long Night of the Sciences
[Virtual Booth (German)](https://slam.phil.hhu.de/ndw/) · [Long night of the sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Night_of_the_Sciences)

The Long Night of the Sciences is a science festival that takes place every two years in the Rhine-Ruhr region. In 2022, the fourth Science Night took place in Düsseldorf. As part of the Slam Lab at HHU, I helped create a virtual and in-person booth for the event, showcasing topics like virtual assistants for medical purposes, biomarkers for Parkinson's disease and the influence of alcohol on speech.

#### Bienvenido Mr. Marshall
[More Information (German)](https://www.romanistik.hhu.de/institut/aktivitaeten/workshop-filmuntertitelung/aktuelles/luis-garcia-berlanga-filmreihe-in-fuenf-staedten-und-drei-laendern-1)  ·  [About the movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_Mr._Marshall!)

While the Spanish regisseur Luis García Berlanga is considered one of the most important and unique film directors in Spain, he did not rise to the same level of fame in other countries outside of his homeland. As part of an annual workshop for movie subtitles from the Romance department at the Heinrich-Heine Universite, I helped create German subtitles for the movie "Bienvenido Mr. Marshall" by Luis García Berlanga. The subtitled movie was published and shown at the film museum and cinema "Black Box" in Düsseldorf.
