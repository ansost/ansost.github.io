<ul>
  <li>Teaching Assistant for <a href="https://akkikek.xyz/about.html">Akhilesh Kakolu Ramarao</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Have you ever been curious about why Voice Assistants (Siri, Amazon Echo and Google Assistant) sometimes struggle to understand your English accent? As linguists, we can play a crucial role in evaluating these sophisticated systems. In this class, you will assess the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition systems (ASR) by evaluating them against your own recorded speech and other existing speech recordings. You will learn how to use recording equipment in a laboratory setting as well as how to cut and prepare audio for further processing.</p>

  <li>Class material: <a href="https://docs.slam.phil.hhu.de/#/nvidia_setup">Nvidia Kit instructions</a></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Course Description:</strong> Have you ever wondered why the voice from Google Maps sounds so robotic? In this course, you will take a look inside the black box of language technology and learn how text-to-speech systems work. Using mini-portable computers, NVIDIA® Jetson Nano Developer Kit, you will build your own text-to-speech system that can synthesize written text into spoken language.</p>

  <p><strong>Course description:</strong> Have you ever wondered why Voice Assistants (Siri, Amazon Echo and Google Assistant) could not quite understand your English accent? We, as linguists, can play an important role as evaluators of such complex systems. Through this beginner-friendly course, you will open up the black box of language technology by building them with mini-portable computers. In the process, you will acquire new digital skills that complement your linguistic training. Specifically, you will be given the unique opportunity to apply your English and linguistic knowledge for building everyday language technology applications such as evaluating the voice assistant’s ability to perceive and produce different English accents, prosody patterns, styles, and emotions. You will be primarily working with mini-portable computers, <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit">NVIDIA® Jetson Nano Developer Kit</a>. With the NVIDIA Kits, you will build an interactive machine that can speak (Speech Synthesis - convert written text into spoken speech) and can listen (Speech Recognition - transcribe spoken speech into written text). Furthermore, you will evaluate automated systems using linguistic analysis and provide you an opportunity to come up with novel linguistically-motivated evaluation methods.</p>
